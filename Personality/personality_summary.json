    "common_misconceptions": "Writing seems abstract, but academic papers have so much structure - it's really just filling them out with specificity",
    "five_paragraph_essay": "Structure is necessary for flow and sense. Can have more or less than 3 body paragraphs if needed, but generally successful",
