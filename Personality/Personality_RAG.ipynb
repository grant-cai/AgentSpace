    "# Developing an Agent Based on a Person's Personality\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the inception of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, people have looked to LLMs to help assist them with their everyday lives. It's served as a tutor, a guide, and a general purpose assistant, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all of the advancements with ChatGPT, its personality has generally been to behave as a one-size-fits-all assistant. The goal of AgentSpace is to build more specific agents that are tailored specifically to accomplish certain tasks, capturing the knowledge and personalities of various professionals like lawyers and tax professionals. The task involves utilizing a RAG-based system to employ the power of LLMs to build a knowledge RAG based on the person's various knowledge, as well as another RAG to capture their personality.\n",

    "\"Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People\" by Joon Sung Park et al. (Stanford/Google DeepMind 2024) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10109) utilized roughly 2 hour long qualitative interviews to create agents of their interviewees. Based on the interview transcripts, they created agents and had them answer similar questions to the actual interviewees. Utilizing the General Social Survey, Big Five Personality Interview, and Economic Behavioral Games, they found that the generative models did a generally good job of predicting participant's behavior and attitudes well:\n",
